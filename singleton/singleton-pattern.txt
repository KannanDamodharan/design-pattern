Singleton Pattern:
	It'a a creational design pattern. It is used when we want to a single instance of a class to control actions across a system.
	Eg:- configuration manager, a thread pool or a database connection.
	
	drawback:-
	It's not thread safe. We can add synchronization but it will affect performance. 
	Lazy Singleton:- creates instance on demand.
	Eager Singleton:- creates instance during class loading time.
